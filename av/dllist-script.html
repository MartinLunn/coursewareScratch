A DLList, or doubly-linked list implements the full List interface and also provides an efficient implementation of the Deque interface

<div class="pause">breath</div>

The basic building block of a DLList is a <em>node</em>. A node has three parts: a piece of data, that we call $x$, a pointer to the next list node, that we call $\mathtt{next}$, and a pointer to the previous list node, that we call $\mathtt{prev}$.

<div class="pause">1</div>

The nodes of a DLList are linked together, one after another, through their $\mathtt{next}$ and $\mathtt{prev}$ pointers.

<div class="pause">1</div>

To make things simpler, and avoid special cases, it helps to introduce a special empty node that we call the <em>dummy</em>.

<div class="pause">1</div>

The dummy's next pointer points to the first node in the list and the dummy's last pointer points to the last node in the list.

<div class="pause">0</div>

We can think of the dummy as a node that appears both before the first node in the list and after the last node in the list.

<div class="pause">1</div>

The DLList itself consists of the dummy node and an integer, $n$, that keeps track of the number of items in the list.

<div class="pause">1</div>

Most of the work required in implementing the List operations comes from finding the node in a DLList that has a specific index, $i$.  This is done by a helper function called getNode(i).

<div class="pause">1</div>

To get the $i$th node in a DLList, we first check if the $i$th node is in the first or second half of the list by comparing $i$ to $n/2$.

<div class="pause">1</div>

If $i< n/2$, then the $i$th node is in the first half of the list, and we can get to it by starting at the dummy and following $i+1$ next pointers.

<div class="pause">4</div>

If $i \ge n/2$, then the $i$th node is in the second half of the list, and we can get to it by starting at the dummy and following $n-i$ prev pointers.

<div class="pause">4</div>

Putting all this together, this means that we can get to the $i$th node in a DLList by following the minimum of $i+1$ or $n-i$ pointers.

<div class="pause">2</div>

This means that the getNode(i) function runs in $O(1+\min\{i, n-i\})$ time.
It takes at least constant time, plus time proportional to the minimum
of $i$ and $n-i$.

<div class="pause">2</div>

With the getNode(i) function, getting and setting values in a DLList becomes easy.


<div class="pause">2</div>

To get the $i$th value in a DLList we just get the $i$th node and return its value.

<div class="pause">1</div>

This takes only constant time, once we've found the $i$th list node.

<div class="pause">2</div>

To set the $i$th value in a DLList we just get the $i$th node and set its value.

<div class="pause">1</div>

Again, this takes only constant time, once we've found the $i$th list node.

<div class="pause">2</div>

Adding and removing from a DLList is also fairly easy, but requires some
careful pointer manipulations to get everything working just right.

<div class="pause">2</div>

To add a new value to a DLList at position $i$, we first create a new
node, $u$, that contains the value we want to add.

<div class="pause">2</div>

Next, we use the getNode function to find the node, $w$, currently at position $i$.

<div class="pause">2</div>

Now we have to set four pointers to splice the new node into the list:
Two of these pointers are in the new node, $u$,.  One pointer is
$w$'s prev pointer and the last pointer is in the node that appears
before $w$.

<div class="pause">1</div>

These pointer changes only require four lines of code, but it's easy to
get them wrong.

<div class="pause">2</div>

Finally, we increment the value $n$, since the list now contains one
more value than before.  Note that adding the new node $u$ to the list
implicitly changes the indices of all the nodes that come after $u$.

<div class="pause">2</div>

As with the other DLList operations, add(i,x) only takes constant time
once we've we've used getNode(i) to find the $i$th node in the list.

<div class="pause">1</div>

Removing the $i$th value from a DLList is a bit easier. We first use
the getNode(i) function to find the $i$th list node, $u$.

<div class="pause">1</div>

Next, we update two pointers to splice $u$ out of the list.  One pointer
is in the node preceding $u$ and the other is the node that comes
after $u$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

If we're working in a programming language that requires explicitly freeing memory then we should now free the space allocated to node $u$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

Finally, we decrement the value of $n$, since the list now contains one less value.  Note that removing the node $u$ has the side-effect of implicitly changing the indices of all the nodes that came after $u$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

Again, the remove(i) operation only takes constant time
once we've used getNode(i) to find the $i$th node in the list.

<div class="pause">4</div>

To summarize:  A DLList implmements the List interface so that each of the operations get(i), set(i,x), add(i,x), and remove(i) runs in time $O(1+min\{i,n-i\})$.

When we specialize this to the Deque interface, each of the operations addFront(), addBack(), removeFront(), adn removeBack() runs in constant time.

<div class="pause">10</div>
